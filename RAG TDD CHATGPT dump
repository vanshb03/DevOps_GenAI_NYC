Kent Beck's Test Desiderata includes principles like:

Tests Must Be Readable: Tests should be easily understandable by anyone, not just the original author.
Tests Should Be Fast: Quick test execution encourages frequent testing, aiding in early issue detection.
Tests Should Be Deterministic: Tests should produce consistent results to reliably catch regressions.
Tests Should Be Isolated: Each test should operate independently, avoiding dependencies on the execution order.
Tests Should Be Repeatable: Running a test multiple times should yield the same result.
Tests Should Be Self-Checking: Tests should automatically determine success or failure without manual intervention.
Tests Should Be Timely: Write tests before the corresponding code to ensure a focus on the expected behavior.
Tests Should Be Informative: Failed tests should provide clear and actionable information for debugging.
Tests Should Be Maintainable: As the code evolves, tests should evolve with it, staying relevant and effective.
What problems would I ask a novice programmer to solve using TDD and these principles?

Encourage writing tests that verify the game rejects invalid moves and accepts valid ones.
Test for Game Outcome:
Question: What tests would you create to ensure the game correctly determines the winner based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors?
Prompt the student to write tests for different combinations of player moves and expected outcomes.
Test for Randomized Computer Move:
Question: How can you test that the computer's move is randomized and follows a fair distribution (Rock, Paper, Scissors)?
Guide them in creating tests to ensure the randomness of the computer's move over multiple game plays.
Test for Ties:
Question: What tests would cover scenarios where the game results in a tie?
Have them write tests where both players choose the same move and confirm the game correctly handles ties.
Test for Player Input Handling:
Question: How would you test the game's response to different types of player inputs (uppercase, lowercase, mixed case)?
Encourage writing tests to ensure the game handles player inputs consistently.
Test for Game State Changes:
Question: What tests would you create to verify that the game state changes appropriately after each round?
Guide them in writing tests to confirm the update of scores, round counts, or any other relevant game state.
Test for End Game Conditions:
Question: How can you ensure that the game correctly ends when a predefined number of rounds is reached?
Prompt them to write tests checking if the game concludes after the specified number of rounds.
These questions help students consider various aspects of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game and develop tests to ensure its functionality, robustness, and correctness.
Give example test cases for edge conditions 

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here are example test cases for edge conditions in a Rock, Paper, Scissors game:

Edge Case: Empty Move:
Test Case: Ensure the game handles a scenario where a player makes an empty move.
Expected Outcome: The game should reject the empty move and prompt the player to enter a valid move.
Edge Case: Invalid Move:
Test Case: Test how the game responds when a player makes an invalid move (e.g., "Sword").
Expected Outcome: The game should reject the invalid move and ask the player to enter a valid move.
Edge Case: Case Sensitivity:
Test Case: Verify that the game treats uppercase and lowercase moves equally (e.g., "Rock" vs. "rock").
Expected Outcome: The game should recognize both cases as the same move.
Edge Case: All Ties:
Test Case: Play a series of rounds where both players consistently choose the same move.
Expected Outcome: The game should result in ties for each round, and the overall outcome should be a draw.
Edge Case: Maximum Rounds Reached:
Test Case: Play the game with a limit of 3 rounds and ensure it correctly ends after the third round.
Expected Outcome: The game should announce the winner or declare a draw if there's no clear winner after the specified rounds.
Edge Case: Maximum Score Reached:
Test Case: Play the game with a score limit of 5 and ensure it correctly ends when a player reaches the winning score.
Expected Outcome: The game should declare the player with the highest score as the winner.
Edge Case: Random Computer Moves:
Test Case: Run the game for a large number of rounds and check if the computer's moves appear to be evenly distributed.
Expected Outcome: The distribution of computer moves should approximate a fair random distribution.
These edge test cases cover scenarios that go beyond typical gameplay, helping ensure the Rock, Paper, Scissors game handles various situations effectively.
Give me an example of edge case tests in python.

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an example of edge case tests in Python using the unittest module for a simplified Rock, Paper, Scissors game:

python
Copy code

            self.game.play_round("Rock", "Scissors")
        self.assertEqual(self.game.check_winner(), "Player 1 wins!")

    def test_random_computer_moves_distribution(self):
        move_counts = {"Rock": 0, "Paper": 0, "Scissors": 0}
        for _ in range(1000):
            computer_move = self.game.get_computer_move()
            move_counts[computer_move] += 1

        # Assert that each move occurs approximately 1/3 of the time
        for count in move_counts.values():
            self.assertAlmostEqual(count, 1000 / 3, delta=50)
